This is a simple project developed as part of a challenge during my trainee tasks. Using Next.js, React Hook Form, Zod, Tailwind, and ShadCN components, I created a basic form with text fields, select inputs, and a PDF file upload. The form data is sent to an endpoint, and after submission, the information can be viewed in a table that retrieves the data from the same endpoint.

## ðŸ’» Installation

First, you must clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedroalvesss/scpc-form-challenge/
```

Then, you must install the dependecies. (if you use yarn, i have a advice to you: dont use)

```bash
npm install
```

And finally to run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```
